Chapter 1 Tourism:

Maya: Away from Crowds
  
Central America is home to many secret treasures for tourists who like to avoid the crowds, including numerous ancient Maya settlements.

The seven countries of Central America --Guatemala,Panama,Belize,Honduras,ElSalvador,Nicaragua and Costa Rica - are full of natural beauty and cultural treasures. Many of the region's nature reserves, ancient Maya settlements and colonial cities have been declared world cultural heritage sites by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

There are lots of volcanoes and an exotic animal kingdom to explore, yet few people outside the region know of them. The view into the crater of the Masaya Volcano in Nicaragua is a breathtaking experience,enlivened by the accompanying strong smell of sulphur and the loud screaming of parrot.
