PM2 embed a simple and powerful deployment system with revision tracing. It's based on https://github.com/visionmedia/deploy

A step-by-step tutorial is available here : Deploy and Iterate faster with PM2 deploy

Getting started with deployment
Please read the Considerations to use PM2 deploy

1- Generate a sample ecosystem.json file that list processes and deployment environment

$ pm2 ecosystem
In the current folder a ecosystem.json file will be created. It contains this:

{
  "apps" : [{
    "name"      : "API",
    "script"    : "app.js",
    "env": {
      "COMMON_VARIABLE": "true"
    },
    "env_production" : {
      "NODE_ENV": "production"
    }
  },{
    "name"      : "WEB",
    "script"    : "web.js"
  }],
  "deploy" : {
    "production" : {
      "user" : "node",
      "host" : "212.83.163.1",
      "ref"  : "origin/master",
      "repo" : "[email protected]:repo.git",
      "path" : "/var/www/production",
      "post-deploy" : "pm2 startOrRestart ecosystem.json --env production"
    },
    "dev" : {
      "user" : "node",
      "host" : "212.83.163.1",
      "ref"  : "origin/master",
      "repo" : "[email protected]:repo.git",
      "path" : "/var/www/development",
      "post-deploy" : "pm2 startOrRestart ecosystem.json --env dev",
      "env"  : {
        "NODE_ENV": "dev"
      }
    }
  }
}
Edit the file according to your needs.

2- Be sure that you have the public ssh key on your local machine

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
$ ssh-copy-id [email protected]
3- Now initialize the remote folder with:

$ pm2 deploy <configuration_file> <environment> setup
E.g:

$ pm2 deploy ecosystem.json production setup
This command will create all the folders on your remote server.

4- Deploy your code

$ pm2 deploy ecosystem.json production
Now your code will be populated, installed and started with PM2


Deployment options
Display deploy help via pm2 deploy help:

$ pm2 deploy <configuration_file> <environment> <command>

  Commands:
    setup                run remote setup commands
    update               update deploy to the latest release
    revert [n]           revert to [n]th last deployment or 1
    curr[ent]            output current release commit
    prev[ious]           output previous release commit
    exec|run <cmd>       execute the given <cmd>
    list                 list previous deploy commits
    [ref]                deploy to [ref], the "ref" setting, or latest tag
命令
$ pm2 startOrRestart all.json            # Invoke restart on all apps in JSON
$ pm2 startOrReload all.json             # Invoke reload
$ pm2 startOrGracefulReload all.json     # Invoke gracefulReload

注意事项
You might want to commit your node_modules folder (#622) or add the npm install command to the post-deploy section: "post-deploy" : "npm install && pm2 startOrRestart ecosystem.json --env production"
Verify that your remote server has the permission to git clone the repository
You can declare specific environment variable depending on the environment you want to deploy the code to. For instance to declare variables for the production environment, just add "env_production": {} and declare that variables.
PM2 will look by default to ecosystem.json. So you can skip the options if it's the case
You can embed the "apps" & "deploy" section in the package.json
It deploys your code via ssh, you don't need any dependencies
Process are initialized / started automatically depending on application name in ecosystem.json
